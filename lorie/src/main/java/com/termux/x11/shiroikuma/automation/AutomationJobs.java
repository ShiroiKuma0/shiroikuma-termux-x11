 * The jobs the data door has started, and the flag each of them watches to stop.

 * files, and refusing that is {@link AutomationDataService}'s business. What this owns is the mapping
 * from the id a caller was handed to a cancellation it can act on, which must outlive the binder call
 * that created it and be reachable from a service that never saw the caller.
 *
 * <p>Process-local and never persisted, deliberately: a persisted "running" flag survives the crash
