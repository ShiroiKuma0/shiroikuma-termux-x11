/**
 * Who is allowed through the automation data door ({@link AutomationProvider}), and how that is
 * decided. Copied verbatim from raikidoban's port of 自由作業盤's {@code AutomationCallers.kt} — self-contained and
 * app-independent, so every sister app checks callers the same way.
 *
 * <h3>Why not a token</h3>
 *
 * The token this replaces was a 48-character secret 白い熊 pasted from one app's settings into
 * another's. It cannot survive a wipe, which is fatal for the case the whole family now exists to
 * serve: 応用管理 restoring apps and their data onto a clean phone, where nothing is configured yet.
 *
 * <h3>Why not a {@code shiroikuma.*} prefix</h3>
 *
 * Because that is not an identity. What makes {@code getCallingPackage()} worth anything is that a
 * package name <b>cannot be taken while the real package is installed</b> — package names are not a
 * namespace anyone owns, so any sideloaded app may call itself {@code shiroikuma.evil} and pass a
 * prefix test. Since the caller supplies the file descriptor an export is written into, a prefix
 * check would hand such an app the complete data of every sister app in turn: <b>strictly weaker
 * than the token it replaces</b>.
 *
 * <h3>What is actually checked, in order</h3>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>An exact name</b> from {@link #CALLERS}. Never a prefix. A third caller is a one-line
 * change here.</li>
 * <li><b>The uid agrees.</b> {@code getCallingPackage()} reflects the caller's <i>declared</i>
 * attribution, and packages sharing a uid are not distinguished by it, so it is confirmed against
 * {@link PackageManager#getPackagesForUid} for the uid the kernel reports. That answer cannot be
 * borrowed.</li>
 * <li><b>The signing certificate matches a pinned hash.</b> This closes the real gap: <i>whichever
 * caller package is absent from the device is a name anyone can take</i>, and a clean phone is
 * precisely a device where not everything is installed yet — the moment the assumption is weakest is
 * the moment it is most needed.</li>
 * </ol>
